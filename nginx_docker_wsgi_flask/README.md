Example of flask, nginx, uwsgi, and gunicorn
## Useage
```
$ docker build -t app_nginx_uwsgi ./
$ docker run -p 8080:80 app_nginx_uwsgi
```
You can see "Hello World!!" generated by Flask by accessing "http://localhost:8080/".  
You can select gunicorn or uwsgi for WSGI tool (gunicorn is selected by default).

## Memo
If you don't use `&` at nginx activation command in app/startup.sh,the below commands are not executed.
So please add `&` except for last command in the script.  
```
ex. nginx -g "daemon off; &"
```
